       behavior should be mostly tested in the "matching" integration tests

       direct unit tests for this function).

       Parameters
       ----------

       table: pd.DataFrame (or pd.SparseDataFrame)
            A DataFrame created from a BIOM table. The index of this DataFrame
            should correspond to observations (i.e. features), and the columns
            should correspond to samples.

            Note that the input BIOM table might contain features or samples
            that are not included in feature_ranks or sample_metadata,
            respectively -- this is totally fine. The opposite, though, is
            where things get to be a problem: if any of the features in
            feature_ranks are not present in the table, or if all of the
            samples in sample_metadata are not in the table, then this will
            raise errors.

       feature_ranks: pd.DataFrame
            A DataFrame describing features' "ranks" along ranking(s). The
            index of this DataFrame should correspond to feature IDs, and the
            columns should correspond to different rankings' names.

       sample_metadata: pd.DataFrame
            A DataFrame describing sample metadata. The index of this DataFrame
            should describe sample IDs, and the columns should correspond to
            different sample metadata fields' names.

       Returns
       -------

       (m_table, m_sample_metadata): both pd.[Sparse]DataFrame
            Versions of the input table and sample metadata only containing
            samples shared by both datasets. The table will also only contain
            features shared by both the table and the feature ranks.

            (None of the features in the feature ranks should be dropped during
            this operation, so we don't bother returning the feature ranks
            DataFrame.)

       Raises
       ------

       If any of the features described in feature_ranks are not present in
       the table, this will raise a ValueError.

       If all of the samples described in sample_metadata are not present
